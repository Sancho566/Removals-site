    "content_html": "\n<p>Packing well saves time and reduces the risk of damage. These 10 packing tips will help you prepare efficiently for moving day.</p>\n<h2>1. Start early and make a plan</h2>\n<p>Begin packing non-essential items several weeks in advance. Create a room-by-room plan so you don't rush at the last minute.</p>\n<h2>2. Use quality packing materials</h2>\n<p>Invest in sturdy boxes, bubble wrap, packing tape and markers. Reusing damaged boxes increases the chance of breakage.</p>\n<h2>3. Label boxes clearly</h2>\n<p>Label each box with the room name and a short contents list. Add handling notes like <strong>FRAGILE</strong> when necessary.</p>\n<h2>4. Pack heavier items at the bottom</h2>\n<p>Place heavier items on the bottom and lighter items on top. This prevents crushing and maintains balance.</p>\n<h2>5. Protect electronics and valuables</h2>\n<p>Take photos of electronics before disconnecting them, keep original cables together, and use bubble wrap for screens.</p>\n<h2>6. Create an essentials box</h2>\n<p>Pack a clearly marked box with essentials — toiletries, chargers, a change of clothes, important documents and snacks.</p>\n<h2>7. Use soft items as padding</h2>\n<p>Towels, blankets and clothing can double as padding around fragile items, saving boxes and space.</p>\n<h2>8. Disassemble where possible</h2>\n<p>Remove legs from tables and beds and keep screws in labelled bags taped to the furniture.</p>\n<h2>9. Keep valuables with you</h2>\n<p>Jewellery, passports, certificates and anything irreplaceable should travel with you, not in the moving truck.</p>\n<h2>10. Check labels on arrival</h2>\n<p>When the truck arrives, place boxes directly in their destination rooms to save time unpacking later.</p>\n<p><em>Pro tip: ask your removals company about wrapping services for fragile furniture — it can save time and reduce damage risk.</em></p>\n"

Use this checklist to evaluate providers.</p>\n<h2>Ask for a written quote</h2>\n<p>Get a detailed, written quote that breaks down labour, transport, packing and any extra services such as storage or insurance.</p>\n<h2>Check insurance and liability</h2>\n<p>Confirm the company’s liability policy for damaged or lost items. Ask about additional insurance options if you have high-value goods.</p>\n<h2>Read reviews and ask for references</h2>\n<p>Look for recent reviews on Google and social media. Ask the company for references, especially for similar moves and distances.</p>\n<h2>Confirm vehicle and crew details</h2>\n<p>Ask about the truck size, parking requirements, and the number of crew members who will attend on moving day.</p>\n<h2>Find out about permits and parking</h2>\n<p>For city moves, confirm who will arrange parking permits or load zone access if required.</p>\n<h2>Compare multiple quotes</h2>\n<p>Get at least three quotes and compare what’s included. The cheapest option isn't always the best — consider reputation and service.</p>\n<p><em>Local tip: confirm the company's experience with apartment moves, stair carries and fragile or bulky items.</em></p>\n"
